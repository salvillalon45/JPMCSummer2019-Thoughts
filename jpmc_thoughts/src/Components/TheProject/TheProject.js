                  <h2> The Project </h2>
                  <p>Throughout the internship, we worked on implementing from scratch a full-stack web application using Groovy, React, and Spring Boot.</p>
                  <p>Let me give you some background on why we were working on this. Our team worked on a system that clients who are companies depend on for their transactions (so if this system was down, then the companies could not do their transactions). There was a product team that worked with my team and they worked with companies and their invoices. <strong>Here is the interesting part</strong>. The product team will send a file with companyâ€™s invoice information and my team had to get this file and manually copy and paste the information into a system they had.</p>
                  <p>Our task was to remove this manual task and improve it through the web application we were going to implement.</p>
