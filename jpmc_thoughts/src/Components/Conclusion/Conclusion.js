                <p>Honestly it sucked that everything became clear at the last day of the internship, but it is okay. An internship is a learning experience. All of this was a learning experience now I have a better understanding of what it is like working as Software Engineer, what it is like working at a firm, and I got to meet a lot of people. I also got to work with technologies that I never worked before! Overall, I am still grateful for the opportunity of working at JPMC, it taught me a lot of myself and working as a Software Engineer.</p>
