                <h3> Part 2: A Deeper Analysis of What Happened to Me </h3>
                <p>The lesson learned was that I should have spoken up earlier. I should have spoken up about how I felt to my manager or someone else on the team. I need to speak up since no one will know how I felt.</p>
                <p>I felt that I did not speak up, because.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>I knew that there was something wrong, but I said to myself “maybe the other interns will notice how I feel and do something about it.”</li>
                  <li>I knew there was something wrong and I let time do the work of fixing my problems. For example, someone asked me how the internship was going, and I told her that “it will get better.” This statement said that I was going to let time fix what is going wrong and that I was not going to act upon it.</li>
                  <li>Also, I did not speak up because I did not know what was wrong with me so I could not describe it.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Obviously, it was bad that I finally figured out what was wrong with me at the last day of the internship, but honestly it is okay. All of this was a learning experience.</p>
