                <h3> Part 4: What Did I learn About Myself? </h3>
                <p>What Did I learn About Myself?</p>
                <p>I learned that:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>I like that a manager or teammate comes in and checks in on how I am doing in my work. This gives me a chance to show what I am working on and ask questions if I am stuck on something.</li>
                  <li>I feel at times I want to learn a lot which is good! But sometimes I have to calm down because if not I feel like I am behind on my learning (I sometimes feel that I need to catch up with all the technologies since there are other students that already know this. This stresses me out.</li>
                  <li>Sometimes I feel that when I am given a problem. It is my responsibility to solve it and only mine. This is not true. I have a team to work with. It is not just me who is working on it.</li>
                  <li>I learned that I really enjoy doing this type of trips where I go to a place I never been before and stay for months working. But this will be different when I start looking for entry level positions since I will be working there for more than 10 weeks. I feel that I want something closer to home.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
