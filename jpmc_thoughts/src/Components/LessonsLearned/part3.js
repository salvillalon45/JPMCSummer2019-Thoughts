                <h3> Part 3: What Did I learn from this and How am I going to Approach It Next Time </h3>
                <p>Next time when I start feeling and identifying that I am not feeling happy or comfortable, I will remember to the following:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>I need to seek someone to speak about it. It does not always have to be your manager. It can be someone outside your team.</li>
                  <li>Do not let time fix your problems. You have to act upon it and take the initiative. If you are not trying, then no one is going to help you.</li>
                  <li>Speak up. Nobody is going to know how you feel if you do not speak up about it, all you will do is bottle up your feelings and not feel happy.</li>
                  <li>If you are going to speak up about your feelings, remember to back it up with facts. For example: “I feel excluded from the meeting because ….”</li>
                  <li>There will always be something that you don’t know but remember that it will take time to learn it. You won’t be able to learn everything in 10 weeks so don’t beat yourself over it if you don’t learn everything.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Most important of all:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>I was learning, it is not always going to be perfect. Nothing is going to be perfect. There will be many challenges and it is up to us to learn how to react towards it.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Obviously, it was bad that I finally figured out what was wrong with me at the last day of the internship, but honestly it is okay. All of this was a learning experience.</p>
