                <h3> Part 1: Introduction to What Happened to Me </h3>
                <p>With the nature of this project we divided tasks throughout the intern team of 3. There were 3 parts to work on frontend, backend, and continuous integration & continuous deployment (CI/CD). I was in charge of Backend. As I previously mentioned the team has never done frontend or deployment of a frontend application. There expertise is on backend. So, throughout the internship, all of the attention was giving to the other interns and their part of the project. This attention was given since the other interns would encounter problems that they could not fix so attention was given to help fix these issues. This team’s expertise was on backend so they had more code examples for me to reference and see how I can apply it to my backend.</p>
                <p>I noticed how they were mostly checking to see how the others were doing, but they would not check on me. In my thoughts I said, “it is okay I do not mind it”, but in reality, I kind of did. Also, I had no experience using React and JavaScript, so it made me feel even more useless and not important. Little by little it made me feel less and less happy about the internship.</p>
                <p>All of this contributed to me being quiet throughout the internship. I remember we would have intern meetings and they would talk on sections of the project that I was not aware of, so I felt I was not able to help as much…</p>
                <p>You could say “But Sal you should have spoken up and said something” and I did. I told them that I felt I was not understanding what was going and I told them to explain it so that I was up to date, but this was not enough. Due to my lack of understanding and how I felt, I grew even more quiet.</p>
                <p>As the weeks went by, I knew there was something wrong as I was not feeling my best, but I could not figure out why. It was until the last day of the internship where I had a conversation with a teammate, and she helped me figure out why I was feeling like this. The feeling was that I felt I was not contributing. I felt that my part was not important. I felt like this because no one was checking on me. I felt I was just by myself.</p>
                <p>People can say “But Sal you should have spoken up about it earlier in your internship.” You are definitely right; I will talk about that in the next section: A Deeper Analysis of What Happened to Me.</p>
